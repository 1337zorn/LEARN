# Malware and Viruses

## Intro to Malware and Viruses

In this track, we'll get an overview of what *malware* is before diving into *viruses*.

Then, using a bit of Python, we'll give you the tools to build a virus of your own.

### Installing Malware

Malware is *software*. It gets installed just like any other software on a computer.

Can you order the steps for installing malware on your computer?
1. Grant the installer access to parts of your computer to start the installation process
2. Start the installation process
3. Grant additional access while the program is installing
Did you ever notice how much access you grant to software on your computer?

### Granting access

Pay close attention to the permissions you give to software to *create*, *update* and *execute* files.

```py
codeÂ {
    repeat forever {
        create a video file
        play the video file
    }
}
```
```
Creating video ...
Playing video ...
Creating video ...
...
**Computer Crashed**
```
Small and destructive! Make sure to check the source of software before you download it.

### Access to hardware

Granting access to *hardware* like your computer's *microphone* or *camera* gives even more power to software installed on your computer.

### Malware

Malware is any software created explicitly to *damage* or *gain unauthorized access* to a computer, server, or computer network.

Can you name things a person might do with malware?
* Plant programs that spy on people
* Steal financial information
* Send a political message by breaking a government website
Once malware has access to files and hardware on your coputer, it can do all sorts of things!

### Malicious Software

An easy way to remember malware is that it comes from combining the words *malicious* and *software*.

### Virus

A *virus* is a very specific type of malware. It *executes* and *replicates* itself.

If we take the `code` we wrote for videos and include pseudocode for replacing itself, we create a virus. Give it a try.

```
code {
    Create webbrowser file
    Copy code into webbrowser file
    Generate webbrowser executable

    repeat forever {
        create a video file
        play the video file
    }
}
```
```
webbrowser.exe created  
Creating video... 
Playing video... 
Creating video... 
...
**Computer Crashed**
```
See that? the malware is more difficult to get rid of because it *replicated* itself inside `webbrowser.exe` before crashing the computer.

### Executable file

The virus we wrote replicted itself into `webbrowser.exe`. The `.exe` extension means it's an `executable file`, or program, for Windows OS.

Now when a user clicks on `webbrowser.exe` on a Windows computer, they'll execute the virus which will copy itself and crash their computer.

### Host program

Viruses require a *host*; an executable file the virus inserts itself into or attaches itself to.

The virus we wrote disguised itself as a web browser It would be **more effective``if it found programs and attached itself to them.

```
code {
    find Google Chrome
    Attach code to Google Chrome

    repeat forever {
        create avideo file
        play the video file
    }
}
```
```
*** ACCESS DENIED***
```
Access Denied! While viruses attach themselves to programs, it will take more than a bit of pseudocode to beat white hat hackers at Google.

### Depending on a host

All viruses depend on their host programs. If a host program runs, the virus will run too.

How can you successfully remove a virus from a computer?
* Removing all programs hsoting the virus
Yes! Leaving any virus code on a computer will mean the virus will replicate itself again if any of the remaining host programs are run.

### Removing virus code

*Deleting virus code* from all host programs is also a way of removing a virus from a computer.

Due to the replication nature of viruses, a strong programmer can make complicated viruses that are almost impossible to remove.

## Changing Files for a Virus

Let's learn some basic tools for programming a virus.

We'll *manage files* and code *infinite loops* using the Python programming language.

### Prerequisites

If you know how *variables* and *loops* work in another programming language, you have the knowledge to follow along.

### Creating a variable in Python

Let's dive straight into Python by creating avariable. Variables in Python *don't require a keyword*.

Create a `statement`variable and give it an initial value using the equal sign (`=`).

```py
statement = "I will not use my virus knowledge for evil."
print(statement)
```

That's right! We'll use variables to store the location of files later.

### Printin in Python

In Python, we use `print()` to print values to the console.

Printing values to the console will help undestand what files we're accessing later on.

### Infinite loops in Python

One way to really annoy someone with a virus is by creating an *infinite loop*.

In Python, we can create an infinite loop with `while True:`. Meaning the code will eecute while `True` is `True`.

```py
while True:
    print("This wil lnever end.")
```
This infinite loop won't stop printing `This will never end.`.

### Managing files with Python

We know *creating*, *updating* and *deleting* files can make malware very destructive.

Let's see how programmers do those things in Python so you get the basics down for understanding how viruses are created.

### Creating a file

To *create a new file*, we use `open()` and place the file name as a string between the parentheses`()`.

Let's create a new Python file named `code.py`.

```py
python_file = open("code.py")
```
`open("code.py")`created a new file named `code.py` in the current directory.

### Appending to a file

Since attaching viruses to programs is common, let's open a file to *append* code to it.

Opening a file so we can append to it is done by adding a `,` comma and `"a"` inside the parentheses of `open()`.

```py
python_file = open("code.py", "a")
```
We can now write inside the `code.py`file.

### Writing to a file

To append acutal code to a file, we use `.write()`. This adds code without deleting what was previously there.

```py
python_file = open("code.py", "a")
python_file.write("## Appending virus code")
```
Now the file `code.py` contains the comment you appended!

### Closing a file

Its good practice to *close* any file we open. So the last step in writing code is closing the file with `.close()`.

```py
python_file = open("code.py", "a")
python_file.write("## Appending virus code")
python_file.close()
```
Great! Now we don't risk leaving the file open and messing with the data if our program runs for a long time.

### Updating a file

We can also call `.open()`to *open an existing file*.

```py
python_file = open("code.py", "a")
python_file.write("## Appending another comment")
python_file.close()
```
To create a new file or open an existing one, use `.open()`.

Now, instead of creating a new file, you updated the existing `code.py` file.

### Opening a file to read

Getting the content of a file is called *reading* a file.

To read a file, use `"r"`instead of `"a"` when opening a file.

```py
python_file = open("code.py", "r")
```
An easy way to remmber is that `"r"` stands for *read*.

### Reading a file

To get the content of the file, use `.read()`. This *reads* and returns the content of the file.

```py
python_file = open("code.py", "r")
content = python_file.read()
print(content)

python_file.close()
```
*Reading* a file is how you can get the content of the file. This is why the `content` variable holds the content of `code.py`.

### Importing OS

We learned that malware takes advantage of managing files. This is something the *operating system* does on your computer.

In Python, we import the operating system library using the `import` keyword and *os*.

```py
import os
```
*os* is short of operating system.

### print files

To list all the files in the current directory, we add `.listdir()` to os.

```py
import os

files = os.listdir()

print(files)
```

### looping through the current directoy

To loop through the files names from `os.listdir()`, we can use a *for loop*.

Create a for loop to oop for **for each file name in** `os.listdir()`.

```py
import os

for file_name in os.listdir()
    print(file_name)
```
You now have the tools to loop through files in a directory and make changes to them.

### importing webbrowser

If we want to mess with someon's webbrowser using Python, we can import the webbrowser libaray. Give it a try.

```py
import webbrowser
```
Now its time to do something sneaky.

### Opening a website

We can use `.open()` to open a website.

```py
import webbrowser

webbrowser.open("https://getmimo.com/")
```

Awesome work! Python developers try to name tings in a way that's easy to remember. so `.open()` is used to *open* a website.
