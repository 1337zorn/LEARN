### The head element, <head></head>, is a container for information about a webpage, like its title. It goes before the body tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>


### The title of a webpage appears in the tab or window of the web browser. <br>

In the tabs above, there are two webpage titles: My webpage and Google. <br>


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>my Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

### The doctype tells the web browser what version of HTML we're using. Without it, the brwoser might not display the page correctly.
Since we're using the latest version, we use
<!doctype html>.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<HTML>
  <head>
    <title>This is the Title which will show at the top</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1> FBI Captures Bat Child</h1>
    <p> <em>Daring</em> <strong>agents</strong> end boy's<br>
