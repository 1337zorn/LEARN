Variables are called variables because the values they store can change.

Use the = sign to change the value.

  var status = "Watching Netflix";
  status = "Relaxing at the beach";
  console.log(status);

We can update variables as often as we want.
We can also give variables the values of other variables.

  var defaultStatus = "Hi there!;";
  var status = "Playing football";

  status = defaultStatus;
  console.log(status);

When we update a variable, it forgets its previous value.

We can add string values together with a + sign.

  console.log("Followers:" + "55");

We call adding together string values an expression because it creates a single string value.
When expressions contain variables, they use the values in the variables.
We can use console.log() to see the results of expressions.

  var numberOfFollowers = "55";
  console.log("Followers: "+ numberOfFollowers);

Since expressions become values, we can give them to variables just like values.

  var label = "posts: " + "13";
  console.log(label);

There are other kinds ov values like numbers (w/o "")

  var numberOfLikes = 5;

Numbers make it easier to keep track of numeric values. Like the number of likes on a post.

  var numberOfLikes = 5 + 1;
  console.log(numberOfLikes);

We use the * sign to multiply numbers and the / sign to devide numbers.

  var percent = 0.5 * 100;
  console.log(percent);

When we give numbers to variables, we can use the variables for calculations.

  var numbersOfSteps = 70;
  console.log("you're on step:");
  console.log(numbersOfSteps+1);

Since expressions become values we can store calculation results in variables.

  var private = 3;
  var public = 10;
  var total = private + public;
  console.log("Total Posts: " + total);

Exercise:
Build a km converter

  var miles = 500;
  var kilometers = miles * 1.609344;
  console.log(kilometers);
