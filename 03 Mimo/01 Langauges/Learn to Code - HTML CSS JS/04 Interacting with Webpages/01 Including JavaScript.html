<!--

Behind every dynamic and responsive website, there's some JavaScript.

To add JavaScript code to a webpage, we start with the <script> </script> tags.

The script element is the last element before the closing </body> tag in the HTML structure.

In the HTML file, JavaScript like var username = "Lee"; only works if placed inside the script element.

The JavaScript runs automatically when the webpage displays.
Find the output of console.log(username) in the Output tab. (of your browser?)

  <h3></h3>

  
  <script>
    var username = "Lee";
    var tweets = 50;
