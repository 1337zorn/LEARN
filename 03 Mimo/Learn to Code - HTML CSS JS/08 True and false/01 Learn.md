# Ture and false

There's a special value that's neither a string, nor a number:
`true`.

There are no quotes around it, and it's not a numeric value.

True is great for situations like checking if a switch is on or if a feature is enabled.

We can store true in a variable just like a string or a number.

`false` is another special value and the opposite of `true`. We can use it like true.

# Negating Values

A `!` sign in front of `true` makes the expression result in `false`. If something is not true, it has to be false.

The `!` sign is the *negation operator*. It turns values into their *opposite*.
