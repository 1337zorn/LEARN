To make creating interactive webpages even easier,
we can use seperate files to add JavaScript and HTML.

Here, the HTML file is named index.html
and ja JavaScript file, script.js

Instead of adding JavaScript directly,
we're connecting the HTML file to a JabaScript file with the instructions.

To include a script, the opening script tag needs a src attribute.

An included script can access the tags and content of index.html with the document.

We link a webpage like index.html to an script like script.js via
including the script in the webpage.

The document object of a webpage stores the content and tags of the webpage.

<!doctype html>
<html>
 <body>
  HTML goes here
  <script src="script.js"> </script>
 </body>
</html>
