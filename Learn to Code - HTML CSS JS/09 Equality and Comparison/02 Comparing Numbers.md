# Comparing Numbers
## < & >
We can use comparisons to check if a number is less than or greater than another number.

To check ifa number is less than another number, we use the *less-than operator*, `<`.

1 < 235
true

235 < 1
false

To check ifa number is greater than another number, we use the *greater-than operator* `>`.

1 > 1
false

## <= >=
To check if a number is less than or equal to another number, we use the *less-than-or-equal-to operator*, `<=`.

To check if a number is greater than or equal to another number, we use the *greater-than-or-equal-to operator*, `>=`.
