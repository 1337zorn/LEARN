# Building Buttons
With buttons, programs change webpages based on user behavior.
For example, clicking next can run code that cycles through caracters.

We'll learn how to write that code later. For now, we'll focus on the `button`element.

## Button Tags

To create a button users can click on, we need the opening `<button>` and closing `</button>` tags.
## Text between the tags

Writing text like login between the tags changes the text appearing on the button.

## Elements between the tags

Using other elements, like <strong> inside the button element can give a button a bit of style.

## Buttons display next to heach other
Buttons display next to each other even if the're on seperate lines of code.

## Buttons on top of each other
If we want buttons to stack on top of each other, we can use the <br> tag to place each button on a new line.
