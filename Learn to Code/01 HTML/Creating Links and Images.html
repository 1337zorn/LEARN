<!--
  Files that have THML code in them are webpages. And when we join webpages together,
  they become a website.
  That what links do: they link webpages with other webpages and websites.
  Instead of typing a webpage's or website's adress into a web browser,
  links take us there with a simple click.

  Without additional information, alink tag is useless.
  To direct visitors to other webpages and websites,
  a link tag needs the word "href".

  "href" is an attribute.
  Attributes provide additional information about tags and go in the opening tag.

  We set the webpage or website we want to link to with a = sign and add its adress "".

-->
  <a href="https://getmimo.com">Learn to Code</a>

<!--

  There's also a tag to add images to a webpage: <img>
  Just like <br> <img> is an empty tag, which means it has no closing tag.

  To display an image, an image tag neeeds the src attribute. src stands for source.

  There are also attributes that change the size of images. For example, the width attribute.

-->

  <img src="https://mimo.app/r/earth.png" width="100" height="200">

<!--
  Adresses like https://getmimo.com and https://getmimo.com/r/earth.png
  are called Uniform Resource Locatiors, or URLs.

  With URLs, we can access images and link to webpages and websites on computers
  that can be thousands of miles away.

  But we can also access files on our own computers. Then we can use their names without a URL.
  A local file is a file on the same computer as the webpage
-->

<img src="earth.png" width="200" height="200">

<!--
  The file names of webpages end in .html
  And the home page of a website is called index.html
-->

  <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
