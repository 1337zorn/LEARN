Elements on a webpage are rectangular boxes with four layers:

Content, paddings, borders and margins.

Paddings generate space between the content and the border of an element.

To Change the Paddings on all four sides of an element,
we use the padding property.

To change the padding on the left side of an element,
we use the padding-left property.

To change the padding on the right side of an element,
we use the padding-right property.

To change the padding at the top and bottom of an element,
we use the padding-top and padding-bottom properties.

The content of an element aligns along the left side of the element.
To change the alignment of the content, we use the text-align property.

  <p> The terms "left-wing" and "right-wing" were coined during the French Revolution of 1789. When drafting a new constitution:</p>
  <p class="leftWing">People who were more conservative assembled on the right side of the assembly hall, leading to the term "right-wing".</p>
  <p class="rightWing">People who were more liberal assembled on the left side of the assembly hall, leading to the term "left-wing".</p>

Margins generate space around an element, outsite of any paddings and borders.
To change the margin on all four sides of an alement, weuse the margin property.
To change the margin at the top of an element, we use the margin-top property.
Same with bottom and left and right.

Although they're similar, margins and paddings are different.

The padding adds space between the content and the border,
while the margin adds spache between the border and other elements.
