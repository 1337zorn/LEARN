  Awesome websites don't only display images, links and text;
  they also have style!

  We'll now move on to making great-looking websites
  with the help of a computer language called CSS.

  To add style to an HTML element, we start with the style attribute.

  When we add something like "color: green;", we're adding a declaration.
  Declarations are CSS, not HTML.

  A declaration is made out of a property, like color, and a value, like pink.
  The property always comes first.

  We add a : in between the property and the vallue, and a ; at the end of a declaration.

  There are many CSS properties. For example, to change the color of an element,
  we use background-color and set it to a value like darkGreen.

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color: pink; background-color: Teal;">Flowers by Ana</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Font properties - One of the most important parts of a website is the text.
we can modify text in a alot of ways, from the size to the style or thickness.

To change how big text is, we use the font-size property.

We measure elements on a webpage with pixels. To specify a size, we add a number, like 60.
After the number, we follow with the shorthand for pixels, px.

To set the type of the font for an element, set the style attribute to the font-family property.

There are all kinds of possible values for font-family,
from Times New Roman or Arial to Helvetica and Papyrus.

To italicize the text of an element, we use the font-style property and set the value to italic.

to bold the text of an element, we use the font-weight property and set the value to bold.

<!doctype html>
<html>
 <body>
  <p style="font-size: 60px;font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;
            font-weight: bold; color: plum; background-color: pink;">Best Anna - Best Flowers</p>
 </body>
</html>
