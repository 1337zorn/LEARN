Modern webpages have a lot of style, meaning they have a lot of properties to make them look great.

One way to add style to agroup of elements is by setting a style for each elemet individually.

But there's an easier way to add the same style to one type of element.
We start by adding <style></style> tags inside the head tags.

Inside the style tags, we specify which element to style with a tag selector, like p or h3.

We then add an opening brace, {

}
followed by a closing brace.

Now, any declaration we add will apply to all elements on the webpage.

This way, we create a CSS rule.

We can add other declarations as long as they're on another line.

A CSS rule are a selector and the declarations

  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
        <style>
          p {
            font-family:papyrus;
            color: purple;
            font-weight: bold;
            font-style:italic;
          }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h3>List of Pharaos</h3>
    <p>Tutankhamun</p>
    <p>Cleopatra VII</p>
    <p>Ramses II</p>
    </body>
    </html>


<!--

If we want a stlye to apply to the entire page, we can use the body selector!
Inside the body rule, all changes are applied to the entire body.

We can style as many elements as we want inside the style tags,
as long as we add a space between different rules.

Using the body tag is one of the easiest ways to add overlapping rules on elements.
We'll learn about the orther ways soon.
