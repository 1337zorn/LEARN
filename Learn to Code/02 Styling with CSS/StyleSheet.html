<!--

So far we've added CSS inside the HTML file.
A better wayy is to use a different file, called a style sheet.

Take a look at style.css and run the code to see the style sheet in action.

We include a style sheet in a webpage with the link element.
Link is an empty element and goes inside the head element.

To know what kind of file to include,
the opening link tag needs a rel attribute that's set to "stylesheet".

With the style sheet included,
any changes to the style sheet become visible on the page.

  <!doctype html>
  <html>
  <Head>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Water Puns</h1>
      <p>
        Why does Snoop Dog need an umbrella? Fo' Drizzle.
        </p>
        </body>
        </html>

<!--

If there are multiple elements fo the same kind on a webpage,
selectors like h1 h2  or p change all of these elements.

If we want to select one or more elements,
we can set a class attribute for the exact elements we want to change.

Classes aren't unique, so we can set the same calss for multiple elements.

To set a class as a selector in CSS,
add the a period followed by the class name.

<!doctype html>
<html>
 <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
 </head>
 <body>
  <ol>
   TO DO:
   <li class="grey-element">Floss</li>
   <li>Feed Cat</li>
   <li class="grey-element">Nap</li>
   <li>Plan holiday</li>
   <li class="grey-element">Order tea</li>
  </ol>
 </body>
</html>
