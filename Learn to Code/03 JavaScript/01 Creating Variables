Of course, usefeul websites do more than displaying images, links and text.
Tey use dynamic content and multimedia.

We'll now look at making dynamic websites with the help of a computer language called JavaScript.

Dynamic websites can remember information. For that, they use variables.

Like moving boxes, variables have content and names that tell us what's inside.

We create a variable with the word var.

After the word var, variables need names.

These names are like the labels we put on boxes to know what's inside them.

  var city

To create a variable for the city we live in, city is a solid name.

To create variable names with multiple words, we use camel case.

We start with a lowercase letter and capitalize the additional words.

  var homeCity

Variable names can contain numbers, too.
Adding numbers is useful with multiple similar variables.

  var car1

After creating and naming a variable, we use the = sign to store a value in it.
To finish creating a variable, we put a semicolon ; at the end of the line.

  var city = "Chicago";

Strings are words in double quotes.

Lines of code are instructions for the computer to follow.

When we run code, we tell the computer to follow the instructions we put together.

The order of the instructions matters because the computer follows the instructions line by line.

With the special instruction console.log(),
we tell the computer to display a value in an area called the console.

  console.log("Hello, World!")

We can use the console.log() instruction as often as we want.
The computer displays every value on on a line in the console.

  console.log("3,2,1")
  console.log("Go!")

We can use console.log() to display variables too!

  var greeting = "Hello World!";
  console.log(greeting);

When we display variables in the console, their values appear instead of their names.

  var name = "Daenerys";
  console.log(name);

Exercise:

var country = "USA";
var state = "Florida";
var city = "Miami";
