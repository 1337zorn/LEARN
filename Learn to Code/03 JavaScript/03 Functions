Instead of writing the same lines of code over and over,
we create functions to reuse the lines of code.

Just like variables, functions have a name. And just like variable names,
function names use camel case.

Braces {} mark out the lines of code that belong to a function.

  function sayGoodMorning() {
    console.log("Good Morning!");
  }
