<!--

To tell the elements how to respond to say, the click of a button,
we need a way of interacting with them.

The first step in doing that is giving each element an ID.

To set an ID attribute, start by typing ID="" with a descriptive string.

By setting the h3 elemnt's id to "intro",
we ensure all ID values are unique within the html document.

It's important for the first p element to hae a unique ID like id="tweet",
to tell it apart from the other p element.

IDs identify HTML elements and help us interact with them using JavaScript.
