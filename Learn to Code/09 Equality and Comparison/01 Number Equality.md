# Checking Number Equality

## Equality Operator
We learned how to create and store values, but how do we compare them?

To compare if two numbers are the same, we use the quality operator, `===`.

``` 5 === 5 ```

When comparing, there are only two results: `true` or `false`.

When we compare the same numbers with the equality operator, the result is `true`.

When we compare the different nubers with the equality operator, the rsult is `false`.

We can also compare variables with numbers or each other.

## Inequality operator

To check if a number isn't equal to another number, we use the *inequality operator*, `!==`.

We can store the result of a comparison in a variable. 

We can compare values with variables and variables with other variables.
