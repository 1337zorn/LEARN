# Comparing strings

We can use comparisons to check if a string is equal to or not equal to another string.

To check if a string is equal to another string, we use the equality operator `===`;

We can also compare the stored strings of variables with each other.

To check if string isn't equal to anothe rstring, we use the *inequality operator*, `!==`.
