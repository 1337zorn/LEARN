# Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

Welcome to this course on AI, where we'll take you through the basics of what AI is, how it's created, and how it'll look in the future.

We've made a special *chatbot* just for this course. Let's ask it a question.

```
Q: What's the awnser to life, the universe, and everything?
```
```
Mimo-AI: Deletingeverthing... Done!
```
Oh, thatdidn't work out so well. Unfortunately, AI isn't that easy to master.
Let's see why!

### AI

AI stands for *artificial intelligence*. That's just a fancy way of saying it's intelligence created by humans.

There's a particular term for machines that have artificial intelligence. Can you guess what it is?
* Intelligent agents
Agent just means it's something that carries out an action.

### Intelligence

When we talk about intelligence, we're referring to the ability of *gathering*, *processing* and then *applying* knowledge.

Can you order these steps?
1. Gathering data
2. Processing data
3. Applying gained insight

Thats the primary loop any intelligent agent or biological animal would go through.

### AI Caliber

But intelligence doesn't always have to mean something groundbreaking.

The truth is there are different types of AI, all varying in their level of intelligence.

### Ubiquitous

AI is already integrated into many applications we interact with on a **daily** basis, without really being called AI.

If we take a closer look, we can see that AI is all around us, just not as intelligent as science-fiction stories portray it to be.

### ANI

The first and most basic form of AI is *ANI*, or *artifical narrow intelligence*.

It's called *narrow* because it can only perform tasks in specific, predefined *contexts*.

### ANI defintion

Narrow AI can do a task it was programmed to do incredibly well.

But it gets confused if you present it with new tasks that weren't previously defined and programmed.

### Narrow AI can take a lot of different forms.

Can you figure out how many of these examples would be considered narrow AI?
* Speech recognition software
* Self-Driving cars
* Spam filters

All of these are examples of narrow AI. Even though self-driving cars are very sophisticated, you can't tell them to do anything else.

### Chatbots

Just because narrow AI is limited, doens't mean it's not useful. Many companies use ANI *chatbots* for customer service. Some AIs are writers.

```
Q: Write me a Poem.
```
```
Mimo-AI:
Roses are red, viloets are blue
I#mm someday be a better poet than you
```
It's also very likelyou you've recently read something created by an ANI.

### Alan Turing

Chatbots are some of the first AIs that have attempted to pass a famous artificial intelligence test.

It's called the Turing test, named after its creator, Alan Turing.


### Turing Test

In the Turing tst, a human judge has a converstion with another human and a machine.

If the judge can't tell which is which, the AI has successfully passed the test.

### General AI

Passing the Turin test is one thing, but reseachers have their sights set higher.

They want to create *AGI*, which is short for *artificial general intelligence*.

### AGI

General intelligence will parallel *human level intelligence*.

What do you think general intelligence implies?
* Performing general tasks without assistance
* ~~Performing only predefined tasks~~
* Figuring out solutions without assistance

Exactly! AGI will be able to perform general tasks without assistance and figure out solutions on its own.

### Problem step

Which step might be in the way of getting from narrow intelligence to general intelligence?
* Processing data
It's our current limitation. We're not sure how to make machines think the same ways humans do.

### ASI

Once we figure out AGi, we'll be able to quickly move to the next step: *ASI*, or *artificial super intelligence*.

ASI is the one everyone is worried about since it would be something way smarter than most humans. We'll talk more about that later.

## Building an AI

### Building blocks

To reach artificial general intelligence, researchers are working towards advancements in a few differnt fields.

Let's talk abit about these fields since they're the building blocks for many types of AI.

### Natural Language

AIs are more useful when we can communciate with them easily. For that, they need *natural langauge processing*, or *NLP*.

NLP is something we use every day when we ask one of our devices for the weather, the time, or to call mom.

### Idioms

With natural language processing, researchers make machines undrstand things just like a humand would. But that's harder than it sounds.

Which of these phrases would be a problem for an AI to understand?
* Costs an arm and a leg
AI's need to be very sophisticated to understand things like figures of speech without taking them literally.

### Learning

Speech recognition is excellent for getting input, but machines also need to *learn* from gathered *data*.

For that, there's a whole domain of AI called *machine learning*. Machine learning is such a vital step that it's often confused for AI.

### Machine Learning

The simple version of machine learning is this: we give a machine a lot of data regarding a topic. Let's say images of cats.

After showing it hundreds, or even thousands of cats, we then give it a  test. For example, asking it to name the animal in this picture.

We know we've succeeded when the machine can recognize a concept on a regular basis.

### Representation of data

AI's also need ways of representing data. Better said, they need a way of storing information, accessing it and compairing it.

Good data representation allows AIs to make better *decisions*.

### Many Ways
But how can AIs represent decisions in a comparable way that allows them to see the pros  and cons each options offers?
```
           A 
          / \
         /   \
        B     C
       / \     \
      /   \     \
     D     E     F
```
We can thin kof decisions as **branching off** into different possible outcomes. We can then represent them in something called a *decision tree*.

### Decision tree
For example, we can use a decision tree to plan a trip from Vienna to Bratislava.

Which branch allows us to get there and take the **least** amount of decisions?
```
       Vienna
        / \
       /   \
    Brno   Bratislava 
     / \
    /   \
Prague  Bratislava
```
* Vienna -> Bratislava

Exactly! This allows us to see which option has the fewest steps. This doesn't always mean it's the right decision though.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

More complicated versions of decision trees are used in all kinds of applications. That's what AIs use to win at *tic-tac-toe* or *chess*. 

AIs use similar methods to make decisions all the time.

### Reasoning

AIs also need to come to logical conclusions through *reasoning*.

Many instances of reasoning in AIs is done through *propositional logic*.

### Propositional Logic

We use propositional logic to simplify language into small parts and then give them values like true or false.
```
If I stay inside then I'll be bored.
   |___________|      |___________|
         A                  B
```
In this example an AI can then judge the truth of `A` and `B` separately and then the truth value of the entire sentence.

### Detail

But using things like propositional logic and decision trees requires a lot of computing power due to the level of detail.

Current hardware limitations mean it would take very long to reach any conclusion.

### Intuition

For that reason, reserchers are also looking into making AI that can have human-like *intuition*.

AI intuition is still a theory, but it would help machines solve **uncertain situations** where there isn't enough data, or there's too much.

### AGI

As reserchers make progress on all of these fronts, AGI becomes more of a reality.

And as soon as that becomes a reality, we'll quicly move towards the next step, artificial superintelligence.

## Super Intelligence

### Super AI

Aritfical narrow intelligence can be impressive, while artificial general intelligence will probably change the way we live.

But both can't compare to the future of AI, *artificial super intelligence*.

Let's see what would be needed to reach that level.

### Progress

The path toward super intelligence will probably be a way shorter than the one from narrow to general intelligence.


### Field Advancements
Researchers are continually gaining ground in all domains of AI, from machine learning to reasoning, or knowledge representation.

### Computational power
So what are some steps necessary for advancing AI technology? One of the first steps is to improve computional power.

Luckily, the computional power of hardware is acceleration at a steady and **exponential** rate.

### Moore's law

It's so steady that it's even given rise toa theroy known as *Moore's law*.

The law says that computional power doubles every two years. This law has been very accurate so far.

### The brain

The next step is improving software. One of the main ways of doing that right now is by mimicking the brain through *neural networks*.

Neural networks mimic the brain by storing small amounts of information in each neuron.

### I/O

Neurons *activate* from `Input` to `Output`. In this diagram, it's from elft to right, while they look for information that matches the input.
```
Input -> ... -> Output
```

### Neural Networks

Neural networks can be complicated but here's a simplified version: They split information into a lot of smaller pieces.


### Neurons

When we get input in the first column, we then compare it to the neuron in the next column and the next column after that.

We do this until we get to the output layer and find the best match. This system is similar to that of the human brain.

### Evolution

There's only so much we can do to develop AI. After we provide the hardware and advenced software systems like neural networks AI will have to carry on the work by itself through *evolution*. That is where *genetic algorithms* come into play.

### Genetic algorithms

Genetic algorithms work via *survival of the fittest*. A set of algorithms are created to solve a problem.

The most successful ones are carried over to the next generation and crossed over to create better versions of the algorithm.

### Evolve

Eventually, one of them is successful in not only solving the problem but doing so in an *optimal* way. That will be the *fittest* algorithm.

It's through techniques like these that AGI will eventually develop into ASI.

### Explosion

AI will then be able to evolve by itself faster than we could ever create it. Researchers call this stage an *intelligence explosion*.

It's when the switch from artifical general intelligence to superintellgence will happen almost instantaneously.

### Bostrom

We're not sure if ASIs will be a good or a bad step for humankind.

Nick Bostrom, a leading AI expert, calls it an "extremely difficuld problem with an unkown time to solve it".

The important part is you know about it now, and you can also help humankind figure that out.
